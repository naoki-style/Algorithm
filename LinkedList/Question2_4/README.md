You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
ex)
 Input: number1 - "3"->"1"->"5", number2 - "5"->"9"->"2"
 Output: number1 + number2 = "8"->"0"->"8"
